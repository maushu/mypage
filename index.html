      <p id="kobra">“I made in total 18 murals around the city, and their goal is an urge for peace for all kinds of social justice, against racism, against violence. It was a period of 5 months, filled with challenges, but I leave with a feeling of accomplishment, having achieved something I have dreamed of, painting around New York, a city that is key to the history of street art. Thank you, NY.”<br><br>--Eduardo Kobra</p>
